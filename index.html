              ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I&#39;ve never written a line of
              code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me
              learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
              former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about
              the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.
              They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for
              assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
              outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that
              no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I&#39;ve often referred to
              it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
              certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after
              receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ‚Äù
